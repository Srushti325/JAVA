# Java Data Structures Repository

Welcome to the **Java** repository! This project is a collection of Java programs and code snippets that cover fundamental and advanced topics in Java programming, including:

- Basic syntax and control flow
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Data structures and algorithms
- Sorting and searching
- Recursion and backtracking
- Graphs and trees
- Hashing and bit manipulation

This repository is designed for learning, practicing, and mastering Java concepts for students, interview preparation, or self-study.
